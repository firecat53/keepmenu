There are no command line options, so a man page is reasonable. Just added a note to see the man page if any arguments are passed. Check out the develop branch and see if it all makes sense to you.

I am always confused by commands not reacting on `--help` and still think even if there's no command line option `--help` would be helpful to find out.
