I find myself running into situations where I am constantly using keepmenu in a 5 min period only to find myself faced with another master password prompt even though I was using it a second ago. This breaks my concentration. I could just increase the cache time period right now, but I don't think that's ideal.\n\nFor example:\n`inactive_timeout=1`\nIf it's been 1 minute since you last accessed keepmenu, then ask for the master password again.","files":null}]}
