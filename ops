Should this be manageable via the rofi/dmenu interface or only via the config file? KeepassXC uses an interface like this:\n![2020-04-05_15-04](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47145187/78499112-4eaf2400-773e-11ea-9505-c6eff653ad8e.png)\n\nThe easiest implementation would probably be to be able to overwrite the `string.punctuation` with a custom string from the config.\n\nHowever, defining sets made of custom groups and having those sets of character combinations inside rofi would be very convenient. For example, having set1 with letters, digits, brackets and set2 with all of these plus punctuation symbols configured in the config. One would then select `set1` or `set2` during password generation in rofi/dmenu. This could subset the current selection process for digits and special characters.
