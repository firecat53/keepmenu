I gave it a shot, and think this looks good. It allows me to edit information without my password being immediately displayed.\n\nMy only thought is that some folks might like to still have a menu option under the 'Password' menu that will display the current password. After playing around, I understand that selecting 'Manually enter password' will allow you to do that since the default selection there is the current password, but I suspect that's not the intention of that menu item, and isn't immediately obvious.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"9abffde177dd441442ec1a75d65bf89cdfd1c5ff"},"timestamp":1558543656,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDg4MzM2OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu/issues/33#issuecomment-494883369"},"message":"Heh, after commenting, I now see that you've already added how to use 'Manually enter password' to display the password to the documentation.
