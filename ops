If an entry has only a username or a password, only that field will be typed.\n\nThe AutoType settings from the database are not read. I'll look into it. It might be possible but I'll have to weigh the potential added complexity. Also will have to see if reading that value would best be done as part of Keepmenu or from pykeepass.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"c70b78504189042cfbbc12f0500081b132f90bde"},"timestamp":1521847956,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTgyNDc3Mw==","github-url":"https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu/issues/6#issuecomment-375824773"},"message":"Ah I see, I guess its not worth the effort. The problem only occurs when an Enter is needed in between the username and the password. The command line would be one example.\nGuess its easier to just have the entry duplicated with only the password.
