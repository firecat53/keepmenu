This doesn't look too good because it wastes space. It would be better if the option was changed to be a max lines option, so that the menus are only as big as they need to be, but also not exceeding a certain number.\n\nEDIT:\n\nOS: Arch Linux 64-bit\nKernel: 4.19 LTS\nKeepmenu version: python-keepmenu-git r8.7418838-1 (AUR)\n\nConfig:\n```\n[dmenu]\ndmenu_command = rofi -config ~/main/configs/rofi -dmenu -normal-window \nl = 12\n\n[database]\npw_cache_period_min = 5\neditor = vscodium\ntype_library = pyuserinput\nautotype_default = {PASSWORD}\ndatabase_1 = ~/main/configs/passwords.kdbx \n```\n![Screenshot of asking me for the passphrase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6378869/51448733-904cde00-1cf6-11e9-8a3c-bcdcba958405.png)\n\nI tried modifying the ```lines``` parameter in my rofi config file, but didn't seem to affect the interface for my keepmenu window.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"3c87de25ab8b2ec3449081ec888ea2a273bb79fc"},"timestamp":1547921286,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTgwMjIyMg==","github-url":"https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu/issues/21#issuecomment-455802222"},"message":"I'm not seeing this behavior.
