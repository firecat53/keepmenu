It's an easy install for those that need it.\n\nYes, but not compelling arguments, IMO. A tool messing up special chars in passwords has a slightly unprofessional taste to it, even if it's not the fault of your code. So, I personally would rather have users install it instead of relying on that python lib, which clearly does not work well.\n\n\u003e Did xdotool fix your issue?\n\nYes, but it took quite a while to figure out what the issue was.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"3c87de25ab8b2ec3449081ec888ea2a273bb79fc"},"timestamp":1592669586,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NzAxNDk4OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu/issues/55#issuecomment-647014989"},"message":"I see your point and I will think about it.
