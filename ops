I often use a GPG key and saw that the `config.ini` had a setting for the GPG key, so I set this setting too, I've assumed that it is to save the data read from the database encrypted in memory.\n\nAnd, about the version, it is 0.2.1\nThe installation process was:\n1. First install dependencies manually with `pip`, those that couldn¬¥t be installed like `pygpgme` was because missing dependencies that I installed too, and when all the dependencies were installed, then I installed keepmenu with `pip`.\n\nThank you very much for your effort üòÉ üí™","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"3c87de25ab8b2ec3449081ec888ea2a273bb79fc"},"timestamp":1518821201,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NjM4MDU4NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu/issues/1#issuecomment-366380584"},"message":"It looks like you don't have a database defined correctly...can you paste your config.ini here?\n\nThat being said...are you comfortable using git enough to download and run the development version from Github?
