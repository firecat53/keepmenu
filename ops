I don't have a Yubikey or other similar device right now to develop with. I'm also no crypto expert! In addition, one of my goals is to maintain database compatibility between platforms and keepass versions. [This KeepassXC FAQ answer](https://keepassxc.org/docs/#faq-yubikey-incompatible) makes me think that could potentially be an issue. PRs welcome if someone has the knowledge and a good plan for implementation.","files":null}]}
