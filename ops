The current [implementation](https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu/blob/master/keepmenu#L56) only allows to pick all or none.\n\nI think it would be preferable to be able to set those via the config file or even in rofi/dmenu. I'd help with the implementation as well if my python skills are up to the task.","files":null}]}
