I prefer my dmenu wrappers to be relatively focused on wrapping existing tools into the dmenu interface rather than including the tools in the wrapper.\n\nIt's a great idea, and I definitely think you should open a discussion with the pykeepass folks. If you can get it merged there, l'll definitely work on adding that interface to keepmenu.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"b979fd7f819e0e6ce7ea64a672cbc389503c696e"},"timestamp":1527178830,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTc3NTA3NQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu/issues/8#issuecomment-391775075"},"message":"Sorry for my late answer; I haven't gotten much time for private projects lately.\n\nRegarding inclusion into pykeepass: I'm not sure if the SSH stuff would actually qualify for that library's scope -- but reading and manipulating binaries in Keepass files seems like it would belong in there. I'll see if I can come up with some less hackish way and if the autors would like to merge that. I'll have to look into some differences between the formats though, so it will still take a while given my time budget :)\n\nFor the SSH part, I'm wondering if it would be worth maintaining it in a separate little library (one that basically only implements the part of `ssh-add`).","files":null}]}
