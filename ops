It is possible. Is it worth the added code complexity to save one keystroke? You just have to hit 'Enter' to open the 'View/Type' menu (it's the default selection). Unless you're binding 'keepmenu -d' to a separate keybinding in your window manager, you use more keystrokes to type ' -d' then just hitting 'Enter'. I'm open to more arguments or other possible uses for command line switches, but my instinct is keep it as simple as possible.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"ca493f5ad288dd7f66d858baae4b8270eb470cc0"},"timestamp":1540482263,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzEwMjcwNg==","github-url":"https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu/issues/13#issuecomment-433102706"},"message":"yeah i guess i see your logic and can live with it :D \nI would indeed have 2 separate binds for each argument but i understand your point","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"3c87de25ab8b2ec3449081ec888ea2a273bb79fc"},"timestamp":1540482511,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMzEwNDI2OQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu/issues/13#issuecomment-433104269"},"message":"Go ahead and leave the issue open.
