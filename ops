[Here's a quick tutorial](https://fedoramagazine.org/simulate-device-input-evemu/) that has a pretty straightforward example, and I believe it could be pretty simple to swap in, although I haven't looked through how keepmenu currently does things to know how easy it really would be.\n\nEdit: After a bit more looking another possibility would be [ydotool](https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool)\n\nThanks!","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"3c87de25ab8b2ec3449081ec888ea2a273bb79fc"},"timestamp":1567208351,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjc2ODIwNA==","github-url":"https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu/issues/41#issuecomment-526768204"},"message":"A recent update added ydotool support.
