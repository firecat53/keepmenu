[Here's a quick tutorial](https://fedoramagazine.org/simulate-device-input-evemu/) that has a pretty straightforward example, and I believe it could be pretty simple to swap in, although I haven't looked through how keepmenu currently does things to know how easy it really would be.\n\nThanks!","files":null}]}
