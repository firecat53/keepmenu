For example: 2example43 -\u003e @EXAMPLe43. It seems like the autotyping mechanism thinks that the Shift key is held down or the CAPS lock is on, even though it actually isn't when I am autotyping it. Interestingly enough, this is only a problem inside Qutebrowser.\n\nHowever, I also noticed that when I *did* have CAPS lock on or held down the Shift key, the same result occurred everywhere.\n\nI'm wondering if there is a fix for this problem or perhaps maybe there is something wrong with Qutebrowser in how it somehow thinks that the Shift key is down or the CAPS lock key is on.\n\nSystem: Arch Linux, Linux Version: 4.19 LTS, using i3 Window Manager and Qutebrowser\nInvoking keepmenu by: Using i3 keybinding (alt+shift+space)\n\nKeepmenu Config:\n\n[dmenu]\ndmenu_command = rofi -config ~/main/configs/rofi -dmenu -normal-window \nl = 12\n\n[database]\npw_cache_period_min = 5\ngui_editor = vscodium\ntype_library = pyuserinput\nautotype_default = {PASSWORD}\ndatabase_1 = ~/main/configs/passwords.kdbx","files":null}]}
