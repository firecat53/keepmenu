However, the only thing that keeps me from using it as my sole KeePass desktop client is the fact that it cannot create or manage databases (to my knowledge). For example, if the database file specified in the config file doesn't exist, then keepmenu should prompt you to create it and insert the relevant info (master password, etc.). I would like for there to be some way to create and manage databases so I can use this as my sole desktop client for KeePass.","files":null}]}
