I think it's a problem with the typing library xdotool or PyUserInput, or perhaps how I'm calling them. At some point I'll switch to pynput (#54) and hopefully that will help. I'm open to other ideas on how to troubleshoot, as it appears to be somewhat random :frowning_face: It does feel like sometimes when I'm trying to open keepmenu and type too fast is when the problem occurs...perhaps some unwanted keystrokes get inadvertently typed?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"6040c0554c714a15bfcee150498785e13bbbf98a"},"timestamp":1599227929,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NzE2MjkxOA==","github-url":"https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu/issues/59#issuecomment-687162918"},"message":"I started using keepmenu yesterday and see this some 30% of the time - it does seem to be connected with the shift key somehow not being registered - for example, I've observed an email being auto-typed as `username2domain` instead of `username@domain` (with an US keyboard layout, so `@` is `Shift+2`).\n\nThis is without `type_library` set, but I'll try with `type_library = xdotool` now and see if that helps in any way.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"3c87de25ab8b2ec3449081ec888ea2a273bb79fc"},"timestamp":1599232469,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NzIxMjAxOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu/issues/59#issuecomment-687212019"},"message":"I was also going to try adding in a slight delay between letters, similar to the delay when Keepass or KeepassXC type passwords, and see if that helps (in addition to the pynput switch).","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"3c87de25ab8b2ec3449081ec888ea2a273bb79fc"},"timestamp":1599234467,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NzIzMjE5MA==","github-url":"https://github.com/firecat53/keepmenu/issues/59#issuecomment-687232190"},"message":"Tried with pynput and it seems to be working fine for the most part.
