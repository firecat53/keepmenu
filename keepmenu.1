.TH KEEPMENU 1 "9 January 2019"
.SH NAME
Keepmenu \- Fully featured Dmenu/Rofi frontend for managing Keepass databases.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBkeepmenu\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fINOTE:\fP Only supports .kdbx databases, not .kdb.

\fB1.\fR Auto\-type username and/or password on selection. No clipboard
copy/paste involved.

\fB2.\fR Use a custom Keepass 2.x style auto\-type sequence if you have one
defined (except for character repetition and the \(aqspecial commands\(aq). Set
it per entry or set a default in the config file for all entries. Disable
autotype for an entry, if desired. \fIThese require a pykeepass version later
than 2018/11/06 or > 3.0.2\fP

\fB3.\fR Select any single field and have it typed into the active window. Notes
fields can be viewed line\-by\-line from within dmenu and the selected line will
be typed when selected.

\fB4.\fR Open the URL in the default web browser from the View/Type menu.

\fB5.\fR Alternate keyboard languages and layouts supported via xdotool or
ydotool (for Wayland).

\fB6.\fR Edit entry title, username, URL and password (manually typed or
auto\-generate).

\fB7.\fR Edit notes using terminal or gui editor (set in config.ini, or uses
$EDITOR).

\fB8.\fR Add and Delete entries.

\fB9.\fR Rename, move, delete and add groups.

\fB10.\fR Prompts for and saves initial database and keyfile locations if config
file isn\(aqt setup before first run.

\fB11.\fR Set multiple databases and keyfiles in the config file.

\fB12.\fR Hide selected groups from the default and \(aqView/Type Individual
entries\(aq views.

\fB13.\fR Keepmenu runs in the background after initial startup and will retain the
entered passphrase for \fIpw_cache_period_min\fP minutes after the last
activity.

\fB14. \fR Configure the characters and groups of characters used during
password generation in the config file (see config.ini.example for
instructions). Multiple character sets can be selected on the fly when using
Rofi.

\fB15.\fR Optional Pinentry support for secure passphrase entry.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
\fB1.\fR Python 3.4+. *Note* Python 3.6+ uses the \fIsecrets\fP module for password
generation to improve security.

\fB2.\fR \fI\%Pykeepass\fP and \fI\%PyUserInput\fP\&. Install via pip or your
distribution\(aqs package manager, if available.

\fB3.\fR Dmenu. Basic support is included for \fI\%Rofi\fP, but most Rofi
configuration/theming should be done via Xresources.

\fB4.\fR (optional) Pinentry. Make sure to set which flavor of pinentry command
to use in the config file.

\fB5.\fR (optional) xdotool or ydotool (for Wayland). If you have a lot of
Unicode characters or use a non\-U.S.  English keyboard layout, xdotool/ydotool
is necessary to handle typing those characters.

.SH INSTALLATION
\fB1.\fR \fIpip install \-\-user keepmenu\fP\&. Add ~/.local/bin to $PATH

OR

\fB2.\fR In a virtualenv with pip. Link to the executable in <path/to/virtualenv/bin/keepmenu>

.EX
.RS
\fImkvirtualenv keepmenu\fR
\fIpip install keepmenu\fR
.RE
.EE

OR

\fB3.\fR From git. Just clone, install requirements and run

OR

\fB4.\fR Available in \fI\%Archlinux AUR\fP\&.

.SH CONFIGURATION
\fB1.\fR If you start keepmenu for the first time without a config file, it will prompt
you for database and keyfile locations and save them in a default config file.

\fB2.\fR Copy config.ini.example to ~/.config/keepmenu/config.ini, or use it as a
reference for additional options.

.RS
Add your database(s) and keyfile(s)

To use a command (e.g. gpg) to lookup db password, set \fIpassword_cmd_<n>\fR.

Adjust \fIpw_cache_period_min\fP if desired. Default is 6 hours (360 min).

Set the dmenu_command to \fIrofi\fP if you are using that instead

Adjust the \fIautotype_default\fR, if desired. Allowed codes are the
\fI\%Keepass 2.x codes\fP except for repetitions and most command codes.
\fI{DELAY x}\fP (in milliseconds) is supported. Individual autotype sequences
can be edited or disabled inside Keepmenu.

Set \fItype_library = xdotool\fP or \fItype_library = ydotool\fP (Wayland) if
you need support for non\-U.S.  English keyboard layouts and/or characters.

When using xdotool, call \fIsetxkbmap\fP to set your keyboard type somewhere in
your window manager or desktop environment initialization. For example:

.RS
\fIexec setxkbmap de\fP in ~/.config/i3/config.
.RE

New sets of characters can be set in config.ini in the \fI[password_chars]\fP
section. A new preset for each custom set will be listed in addition to the
default presets. If you redefine one of the default sets (upper, lower, digits,
punctuation), it will replace the default values.

New preset groups of character sets can be defined in config.ini in the
\fI[password_char_presets]\fP section. You can set any combination of default
and custom character sets. A minimum of one character from each distinct set
will be used when generating a new password. If any custom presets are defined,
the default presets will not be displayed unless they are uncommented.

.RE

\fB3.\fR If using Rofi, you can try some of the command line options in
config.ini or set them using the \fIdmenu_command\fP setting, but I haven\(aqt
tested most of them so I\(aqd suggest configuring via .Xresources where
possible.

\fB4.\fR If using dmenu for passphrase entry (pinentry not set), dmenu options
in the [dmenu_passphrase] section of config.ini will override those in [dmenu]
so you can, for example, set the normal foreground and background colors to be
the same to obscure the passphrase.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 3.5
If you choose to store your database password into config.ini, make
sure to \fIchmod 600 config.ini\fP\&. This is not secure and I only added it as a
convenience for testing.
.UNINDENT

.SH USAGE
\fB1.\fR Run script or bind to keystroke combination

\fB2.\fR Enter database and keyfile if not entered into config.ini already.

\fB3.\fR Start typing to match entries.

\fB4.\fR Hit Enter immediately after dmenu opens ("\fIView/Type individual
entries\fP") to switch modes to view and/or type the individual fields for the
entry. If selected, the URL will open in the default browser instead of being
typed.

\fB5.\fR To view a password without typing it, use the \fI"Edit Entries"\fP
option, then select the entry, select \fI"Password"\fP then select \fI"Manually
enter password"\fP. Type "ESC" to exit without making changes.

.SH TESTS
\fB1.\fR To run tests: \fIpython tests/tests.py\fP
