I'm using Arch Linux and installed keepmenu from AUR. Standard inserting (\"username\\tpassword\") is working fine, but when I try to type individual entries with keepmenu, they are input twice.\n\nI recently formated my system (and I'm still using Arch), but the problem persists (it has never worked well for me).\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nBy the way, thank you, It's nice that I can access my password in the way you've implemented keepmenu!","files":null}]}
