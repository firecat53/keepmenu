I keep trying to invoke keepmenu via a keybinding, but it refuses to show up. I typed \"keepmenu\" in the terminal it seems to immediately terminate without showing any output. I tried to kill the keepmenu daemon via ```pkill keepmenu```, which had no effect, which means it probably stopped running. I even tried tried uninstalling and then reinstalling keepmenu, but I still can't open it. Again, it took a reboot to get it to start working again. This is rather frustrating, and I hope that this bug can be fixed.\n\nSystem: Arch Linux, Linux Version: 4.19 LTS, using i3 Window Manager\nInvoking keepmenu by: Using i3 keybinding (alt+shift+space)\n\nKeepmenu Config:\n```\n[dmenu]\ndmenu_command = rofi -config ~/main/configs/rofi -dmenu -normal-window \nl = 12\n\n[database]\npw_cache_period_min = 5\ngui_editor = vscodium\ntype_library = pyuserinput\nautotype_default = {PASSWORD}\ndatabase_1 = ~/main/configs/passwords.kdbx\n```","files":null}]}
